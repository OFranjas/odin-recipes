# Odin-recipes

A basic recipe website.

This project is part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum and was created to practice basic *HTML* and *CSS* skills.

The website has a main index page with links to a few recipe pages.

You can visit the website [here](https://ofranjas.github.io/odin-recipes/).
