    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p class="description text">
      Crispy smashed potatoes are delicious, golden brown, crispy on the
      outside, fluffy on the inside, and these have an extra crispy layer of
      broiled Parmesan cheese on top. There are a few extra steps involved, but
      they are absolutely worth the effort.
    </p>
    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients list">
      <li>
        1 1/2 pounds (1 1/2 - to 2-inch) red skinned potatoes (12 to 16 small
        potatoes)
      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>3 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely shredded (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh italian parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps list">
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a large saucepan, and add enough water to cover by at
        least 1 inch. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until
        potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a
        15x10x1-inch baking pan with foil. Brush foil with 1 tablespoon olive
        oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer potatoes to the prepared baking pan. Use a wide-bottomed glass
        to lightly press down on each potato to smash to about 1/2-inch
        thickness, while keeping each potato in one piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush smashed potatoes with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle
        with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven, uncovered, until bottoms are lightly
        browned and crisp, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn potatoes; sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4
        teaspoon pepper. Return to the oven and roast until potatoes are lightly
        browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the broiler and set a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source.
        Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil until cheese is golden brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Garnish
        with parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
